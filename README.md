# Simple File Extension Sorter
<p>Sorting tool that sorts by file extension and puts it in folders (that are named by extension)</p>
<b>Usage:</b>
<p>-p (prefix) - sets prefixes for folders like '(prefix)txt' or '(prefix)doc'</p>
<p>-n - create folders named by just extensions</p>
<p>-r - sorts unsorted files in already created folders using previous prefix</p>
<p>-h - shows help message</p>
<p>-c - unsort, bring files back from folders (also deleting folders)</p>

## I forgot what i wrote and i dont understand my code lol, there is still some work to do (like what to do when there is already a file with same name in folder) so i need to do something
